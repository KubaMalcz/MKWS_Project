{\bf 1. Introduction}
\end{center}

 In this project, the problem of heat exchange in combustion chamber's wall will be considered. In order to predict the temperature distribution, a special script in MATLAB software has been written. The final version of a program let us modify various input parameters, for example: combustion chamber's and insulation dimensions, parameters of cooling system and mass flow of oxidizer and fuel. The following project will present calculations made for engine designed in MELprop Student's Propulsion Association.     



\begin{center}
{\bf 2. Mathematical model}
\end{center}

 Two different types of boundary conditions has been used. The calculations of temperature distribution has been made using  model below:
 \begin{equation} \label{conduct}
T_{i,k+1}=\frac{1}{M}[T_{i-1,k}+(M-2)T_{i,k}+T_{i+1,k}]
\end{equation}
where: \begin{align*} M=\frac{1}{Fo} \quad Fo - Fourier \quad number \end{align*}

For the first node the third type of boundary condition has been used. Knowing the temperature of gases inside the combustion chamber and convective coefficient it is possible to use the following equation to compute heat exchange:
\begin{equation} \label{third}
T_{s,k+1}=\frac{1}{M}[2CT_{p,k}+[M-2(C+1)]T_{s,k}+2T_{1,k}]
\end{equation}
where:  \begin{align*} C=\frac{\alpha \Delta x}{\lambda} \quad \lambda - conductivity \quad \alpha - convective \quad coefficient  \end{align*}

Convective coefficient has been calculated using equation below:
\begin{equation} \label{third}
h_m=0.024 \frac{C_p G^{0.8}}{D_i^{0.2}}[1+(\frac{D_i}{L})^{0.7}]
\end{equation}
\begin{align*} C_p \textrm{ - specific heat of combustion mixture} \quad G \textrm{ - mass velocity}\end{align*}
\begin{align*} L \textrm{ - chamber length} \quad D_i \textrm{ - chamber inside diameter}\end{align*}

The second type of boundary condition has been used on a border between insulation and combustion chamber wall. To ensure the highest possible safety factor, the ideal connection model has been chosen (fourth type boundary condition):
\begin{equation} \label{fourth}
T_{s}=\frac{1}{p+1}(T_{i}'+pT_{i+1}'')
\end{equation}
where:  \begin{align*} p=\frac{\lambda'' \Delta x'}{\lambda' \Delta x''}  \end{align*}

Beside this equations, special functions interpolating values of specific heat and conductivity have been implemented. These two parameters vary according to temperature, so it is necessary to change these values during calculations.

{\bf 4. Results}
\end{center}

On every graph there are ten lines showing temperature with 3 seconds interval. The highest line shows temperature distribution after 30 seconds of work.

Beside all this graphs, program generates also a csv file, which contains data about temperature in every node and every time step.

{\bf 5. Summary}
\end{center}

All results seem to show too low final temperature. Too low convective coefficient is probably the reason of this fact. Unfortunately there are not simply methods, which let us to calculate real value of this factor. The solution of this problem is to take the value of convective coefficient directly from literature and make all the calculations again. Besides problem connected with convection, there are no other unrealistic results. The temperature distribution looks correct. Also differences between results with and without insulation are physically acceptable.
